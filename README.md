## 🧠 About Me

I’m an **AI-focused developer and product builder** with strong experience across:

- **AI Agent systems & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning (CNN, 3D CNN, YOLO)**
- **React Native / Expo mobile apps**
- **Python backend systems**
- **Startup & product-driven development**

I love building **practical AI systems** that solve real-world problems – from **rip current detection** for beach safety, to **AI assistant apps for immigrants**, to **AI trading systems and conversational agents**.

Currently focused on:
> **AI Agents · RAG Pipelines · Multimodal AI · Mobile AI Apps · Startups**
